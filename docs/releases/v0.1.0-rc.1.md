# v0.1.0-rc.1

Release date: 2026-03-01

This release candidate closes the planned P0 parity scope for Drost's core runtime reliability and operations surface.

## Highlights

- Session lifecycle parity across channels (`/new`, `/sessions`, `/session <id>`).
- Durable dual-session logs (`.jsonl` + `.full.jsonl`) with retention and archive flows.
- Provider failover and route-based provider selection.
- Orchestration lane engine with persisted lane snapshots.
- Control API (`/control/v1`) + SSE event stream.
- Tool policy enforcement and policy denial telemetry.
- Observability JSONL streams for runtime, tool, and usage events.

## Release Gate Verification

- `pnpm build`: pass
- `pnpm test`: pass
- `pnpm smoke`: pass

## Known Constraints

- No distributed orchestration queue backend in P0.
- No web UI control plane in P0.
- Plugin/skills/subagents are P1+ scope.
