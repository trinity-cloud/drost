# v0.1.0-rc.2

Release date: 2026-03-01

This release candidate stabilizes the post-P0 runtime by adding optional plugin/skill/subagent surfaces and completing a broad internal refactor to reduce monolithic files while preserving behavior.

## Highlights

- Optional plugin runtime integration (gateway + config + tests).
- Optional skill runtime integration (gateway + config + tests).
- Optional subagent runtime manager/store/types with gated execution.
- Large module decomposition across gateway, providers, sessions, tools, CLI, and Telegram channel codepaths.
- Docs updates for configuration and control API.

## Release Gate Verification

- `pnpm build`: pass
- `pnpm test`: pass (46 files / 148 tests)
- `pnpm smoke`: pass

## Compatibility Notes

- No planned breaking API changes from `v0.1.0-rc.1`.
- Internal module paths changed; consumers should continue using public package exports rather than deep imports.

## Upgrade Notes

- Standard upgrade from `v0.1.0-rc.1`.
- Re-run local smoke checks if you depend on custom runtime wiring.
